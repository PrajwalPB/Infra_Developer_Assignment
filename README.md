Terraform Kubernetes Blue-Green Deployment Automation
#INFO
This repository defines a blue-green deployment strategy using Kubernetes resources. The blue and green applications are exposed under the same domain (testapp.com), with traffic being split between them for canary deployment.
Both the Deployment, Service, and Ingress configurations for the blue and green apps are defined in the same file.
